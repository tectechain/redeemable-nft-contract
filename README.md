# redeemable-nft-contract

This project contains a smart contract template for NFT collection. Besides the standard ERC721 interface powered by openzeppelin, we added a few features:
### Air Drop
Only contract owner can call this function. Call this function with an array of address and each of them will receive one new minted NFT. 
### Private Mint
Anyone who have the valid signature can mint NFTs by paying enough crypto. The signature is generated by the signer address defined in `EIP712Whitelist.sol`. Contract owner can use `toggleSaleStatus()` to enable/disable private mint.
### Redeem
NFT owner can burn the NFT to redeem a service like an eCoupon. After the NFT is burnt, the tokenId is added to a redeemed arrary and emit an event. To provide the service after the redemption, you will need an offchain server listening to the Redeem event.
### Royalty Fee
NFT royalty fee powered by openzeppelin

### PaymentSplitter
Payment splitter powered by openzeppelin. Used to share the revenue from private mint and royalty fee.
